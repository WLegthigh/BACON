# BACON
Python barcode-sequence counter! Input one (or many) fastq files from a barcode sequencing experiment and match known barcodes to sequences in the files. Optionally, account for barcode mutations using a built-in Levenshtein distance algorithm.

This program is still under development, along with a GUI version for the command-line averse. Proper documentation is also underway.
